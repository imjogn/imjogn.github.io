+++

Iâ€™m currently working on modding my iPod Classic (7th Gen) with a larger 2000mAh battery and an iFlash-Quad for 1TB of flash storage in place of the original hard drive. I had considered a USB-C mod, but the file transfer speeds are capped on this iPod model, so it wasn't worthwhile to me. 

This project is part of a larger effort on my part to break free from music streaming services and unnecessary digital bloat, but I have found that Soundcloud is a worthwhile tool for discovering new projects, so I have decided to continue using that platform.
